Hash Function:
We took inspiration from an existing hashing method, rolling polynomial, except ours is more like rolling multiplication while also incorporating bit shifting to further mix up the output of the hash function. With just a rolling multiplication hash there would be more collisions. What our function does is take the ascii value of a character in a string, multiply it by a  prime (to be determined after testing) and then shift the binary representation of the result right 8 times. Then do an xor operation with the original product and the shifted value and mod that by the given k. After testing with different amounts 8 seemed to give the best variance. We might end up making an array of different prime numbers for each character in a string to be multiplied by and submit that but for now this gives a good variance I think? Dont really have other group variances to compare too.
